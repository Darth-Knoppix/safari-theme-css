Testing `prefers-color-scheme` on Safari Preview

This example uses `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) { ... }` to modify the look of the webpage.
You could also use `@media (prefers-color-scheme: light) { ... }` to target light mode specifically.

As of November 2018, *This only works* on Safari Technology Preview.
